This diploma thesis is focused on the recognition of 3D identifiers in a mixed reality environment, with the aim of improving the interaction and identification of objects in industrial applications. Current methods and technologies of augmented and mixed reality are analyzed in the work and a new methodology for recognizing 3D identifiers is proposed and then tested by practical application. The result is the development of a prototype program that effectively integrates augmented reality for better manipulation and control of industrial processes, emphasizing the modular architecture and extensibility of the system. The work contributes to the theoretical understanding and practical use of mixed reality in an industrial environment.
